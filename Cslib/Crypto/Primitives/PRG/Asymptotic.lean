# Asymptotic pseudorandom generator security

Security for families of generators means negligible advantage for each admissible
adversary family, following [BonehShoup2023], Definition 3.1. Negligibility is
`Cslib.Crypto.Negligible`, Mathlib's `Asymptotics.SuperpolynomialDecay` at natural parameters.
Admissibility is a predicate on the whole adversary
family, so a downstream computational model can express a uniform resource restriction.
This model has a natural-number security parameter and no sampled public system parameters.
Efficiency of generation and sampling is not asserted by these semantic definitions.
Seed and ideal distributions can be supplied explicitly; their defaults are uniform on finite
types. Security is stated through `Game.Secure`, so computational definitions over infinite
sample spaces, such as words, can reuse these experiments.

`SecureWithError` bounds every admissible family's advantage at parameter `n` by `ε n`.
A negligible bound implies `Secure`.

A non-negligible lower bound on the fraction of outputs outside the image rules out security
when the range-test family is admissible. In particular, a bitstring family that eventually
stretches by at least one bit is insecure against any class admitting its range test.
